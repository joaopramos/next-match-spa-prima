# Project

This project is a solution for a technical test for the company Prima UK.

# Getting started

To make a expedite setup I've opted to bootstrap with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I quickly found out that CRA rewrites the file tsconfig.js, so I decided to keep the client and dev server in separate directories.

As such the node modules dependencies should be installed in both the client and server directories.

```
cd server
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

## To run the development client and server

In the client directory, you can run:

`npm run dev`

Runs the client app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Runs concurrently the dev server application. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) for the GraphQl Playground

## Alternatively

The server can be started independently by running

The server side:

```
cd server
npm run start-server\
```

And the client:

```
cd client
npm run start
```
